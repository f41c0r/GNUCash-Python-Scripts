# GNUCash-Python-Scripts
This is a collection of various python scripts to add to gnucash functionality that I found was missing in the main program.

* **calculate-credit-card-usage-permonth.py**: Shows you a running total of sums for spent / paid off amounts on a credit card.
* **assets-minus-liabilities.py**: Calculates how much money you have by performing a sum of your assets minus your liabilities.
* **coinbase-parser.py**: Parses a Coinbase Tax report to show you additional info about your capital gains.
